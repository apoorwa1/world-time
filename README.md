App to check current time of a particular timezone by calling an API

why: 1.Selflearning : of API fetch and event listners. 2. Post pandemic IT teams are intercontinental so having an easu, quick app to tell the current time across regions would be beneficial, before having/scheduling a meeting or doing pair programming etc.

API to be used: http://worldtimeapi.org/

Above API returns the current local time for a given timezone as either plain-text or JSON.
